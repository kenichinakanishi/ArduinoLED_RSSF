# ArduinoLED_RSSF

Messy (but working at the time) code for the interactive graphene sensor exhitibited at the Royal Society Summer Festival 2018, as part of a Cambridge University's Mind the Nano Gap exhibit.


Code was run on a laptop interfaced to an arduino, controlling a custom-built LED array consisting of concentric rings, to allow pressure changes from a speaker below to pass through to a thin latex membrane.
